# Machine Learning Project - PCA and Naive Bayes

This Jupyter Notebook contains a machine learning project where we use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then apply a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the target variable. The project includes data preprocessing, PCA implementation, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

## How to test on your local

1. Clone the repository from Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reya42/Machine-Learning-Project-PCA-and-Naive-Bayes
    ```
2. Open the folder with a code editor.
3. Open a terminal in your preferred code editor.
4. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.
5. Navigate to the MachineLearningProject.ipynb file with your preffered notebook and run the cells to see the results.

## What I Learned
- I learned to use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- I learned to implement and evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier.
- I gained experience in preprocessing data for machine learning tasks.
- I learned how to interpret confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate model performance.
